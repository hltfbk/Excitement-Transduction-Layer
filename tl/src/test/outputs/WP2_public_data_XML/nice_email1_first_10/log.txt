Adding fragment graphs for text: In Standard Magnum - formerly Leisure First - go back to the type and quality of meals you offered until about a year ago . The new food offering is second rate . We are frequent travellers using Quasigo for around 10 return journeys per annum and used to look forward to a decent breakfast going out and dinner on the return . No longer !
Adding fragment graphs for text: Fast , friendly and efficient , also very good prices for travel booked in advanced . However , disappointed with food menu on train as we are vegetarian and vegan . Vegetarian options sold out and on vegan meals
Adding fragment graphs for text: More legroom and shorter , quieter and more targeted announcements .
Adding fragment graphs for text: The service was so poor on the trip and the food was not delivered properly. Yet they did not give us all the food as the rest of the carriages and they claim it was not enough for all the passengers .
Adding fragment graphs for text: Tickets are way too expensive
Adding fragment graphs for text: I am a Carte Blanche member and travel quite a bit - I love how convenient the service is . The trains could use some updating . The food is Standard Magnum is also very bad . However , I like the lounge and the 10 minute check in . Bring back free drinks in Standard Magnum ( with Champagne ) , please ! : )
Adding fragment graphs for text: Do better offers (more promotions, early bird offers etc), more ticket flexibility, better rewards for frequent travellers . Also: make mobile tickets with QR code available for bookings for more than 1 passenger.
Adding fragment graphs for text: When booking the seat numbers could show if it 's a 4 table seat or just a 2 seat . I did n't need a table but a little more leg room would have been perfect .
Adding fragment graphs for text: Make same-day, different times flexible tickets more of an option. There are plenty of seats ...
Adding fragment graphs for text: Friendly guy for service ..he deserves promotion. Food was a bit average. This time train was running as scheduled , but too often delays. In general better than flying Allover ok to good
