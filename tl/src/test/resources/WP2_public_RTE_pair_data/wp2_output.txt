* Short memo about RTE pair data from WP2 data (merged graphs) 

** Data Scope
- NICE (email, speech) and ALMA (social, speech) WP2 merged graphs,
  2012 Sep. 30 version.  

*** NICE EMAIL (file: nice_email_edges.eopformat.xml) 
- 43302 pairs 
- 6431 ENTAILMENT pairs 
- 36871 NONENTAILMENT pairs 

*** NICE SPEECH (file: nice_speech_edges.eopformat.xml) 
- 3530 pairs 
- 177 ENTAILMENT pairs 
- 3353 NONENTAILMENT pairs 

*** ALMA SOCIAL (file: alma_social_edges.eopformat.xml) 
- 194612 pairs 
- 2024 ENTAILMENT pairs 
- 192588 NONENTAILMENT pairs 

*** ALMA SPEECH (file: alma_speech_edges.eopformat.xml) 
- 76756 pairs 
- 146 ENTAILMENT pairs 
- 76610 NONENTAILMENT pairs 

** How the data has been generated?
   1) For each cluster 
      a) extracted "inter-fragment" edges (internal edges among
      fragments are ignored). Edges only exist when they are
      entailment. (directed edges) 
      b) those edges were used as T (from) -> T (to) ENTAILMENT pairs. 
      c) extracted "inter-fragment" node (directed) pairs that *does
      not* have edges between them. This means that they are
      non-entailment. 
      d) used those edges as T (from)-> T (to) NONENTAILMENT pairs 
   2) Once we get edges from each cluster, they are summed up, and
      printed out as EOP RTE pair data XML format. 

** Note 
- Note that (as graphs get larger), "non-entailment" node pairs are
  increasing far larger than entailment pairs. Thus the data is quite
  skewed to "non-entailment" common. 
- The data posted this time has all data "as is". No effort was done
  to make this less skewed, or anything like that. 
- In the EOP format XML file, all ENTAILMENT pairs comes first, and
  NONENTAILMENT pairs comes later in the file. Maybe this order is
  useful to extract ENTAILMENT/NONENTAILMENT pairs only. 

** To reproduce the data from WP2 (or WP2-like) data 
- You might want to regenerate EOP RTE pair data from WP2 data, or
  some data similar from them. You can use the scripts that Gil wrote
  for this. 
- https://github.com/gilnoh/RTEFormatWork  (check WP2-merged-graphs
  directory; Runner.rb is the ruby script that does the
  conversion. all relevant source is there, too.)
