Member of staff who helped rebook my tickets was very friendly and helpful . Much appreciated . I would like much more legroom on Quasigo train . I 'm 6ft 5 and cannot sit comfortably . The international train ( not traintop ) has more than sufficient room . That has been the same for years and needs improvement . Kind regards
