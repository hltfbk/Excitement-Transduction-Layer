Improve the space and customer service experience at Frowntown . Do n't let people not required to be in a queue , queue up and waste others time .This weekend 's mess could 've been simply avoided should you had placed three employees bfr chk in who should go 2 chk in and who should n't . Instead you wasted individuals time and constantly announced msgs people hardly adhered to.as a mass transit provider u should know effective crowd control , NOT ANNOUNCEMENTS
