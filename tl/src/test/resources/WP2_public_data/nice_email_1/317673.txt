Seating is very cramped - my journey has been very uncomfortable with the person next to me taking up most of the space we have . The check in procedure at Frownville station was unclear and the staff not very helpful to passengers asking for assistance . It is a good service from Globetown to Stars Bridge but would improve with more seating space and friendlier staff at Stars Bridge
