I am a Carte Blanche member and travel quite a bit - I love how convenient the service is . The trains could use some updating . The food is Standard Magnum is also very bad . However , I like the lounge and the 10 minute check in . Bring back free drinks in Standard Magnum ( with Champagne ) , please ! : )
