I travel with Quasigo a lot from Stars Bridge to Moonport and I love the service - a couple of tiny things - who chooses the Savory snacks in the waiting room in Moonport - horrible - also the Internet there is always tricky - are there plans to out Internet on the train ? Breakfast - Stars Bridge to Moonport is usually good but dinner can be very hit or miss Is it possible to always get a specific type of seat as a regular business user ?
