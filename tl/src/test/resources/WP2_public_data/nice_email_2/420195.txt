Food not brilliant and when we reached front of queue they had run out of what we wanted . Girl at counter tried elsewhere on train fir what we wanted , said they hadnt so we chose something else . Then suddenly said they had what we wanted after all but by then it was too late . Girl seemed surprised we didnt want two breakfasts !Apart from catering an enjoyable experience
