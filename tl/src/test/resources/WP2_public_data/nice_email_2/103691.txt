In Standard Magnum - formerly Leisure First - go back to the type and quality of meals you offered until about a year ago . The new food offering is second rate . We are frequent travellers using Quasigo for around 10 return journeys per annum and used to look forward to a decent breakfast going out and dinner on the return . No longer !
