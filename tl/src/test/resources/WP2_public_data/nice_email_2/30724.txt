Meal needs to be improved in Standard Magnum .  I have travelled from Troy today and the meal on this train is the only opportunity I have had to eat .  It was not sufficient .  If you are serious on trains being used for journeys such as Troy  -  Sunnyport ,  this needs to be addressed soon .  RegardsMH
