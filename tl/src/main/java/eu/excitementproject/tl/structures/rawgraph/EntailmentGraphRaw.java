/**

 * 
 * The graph structure for the work graph. We call it EntailmentGraphRaw.
 * This graph grows by adding to it FragmentGraph-s by "merging"
 * The merging is done through an interface. 
 * The nodes are entailment units, and the edges (entailment relation) are generated
 * based on decisions from the EDAs. As such there can be several edges between the same
 * two nodes, each corresponding to one EDA query.  
 * 
 *  This graph extends DirectedMultigraph, to allow for multiple directed edges between
 *  the same two nodes. The JavaDoc for the {@link DirectedMultigraph} for information about
 *  inherited methods is here:
 *  http://jgrapht.org/javadoc/org/jgrapht/graph/DirectedMultigraph.html
