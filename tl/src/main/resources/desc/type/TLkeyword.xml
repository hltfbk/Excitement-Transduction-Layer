      <description>The annotation marks a keyword (or a keyphrase, no restriction on the number of terms in it), that is relevant for the  application side (TL layer user).
The annotation will be used in the TL library to extract relevant fragments. 

It does not have any specific features, and annotation itself (begin - end) is meaningful. </description>
